In 1976, a group of rhesus monkeys escaped from the Memphis Zoo. They crossed North Parkway and entered the Rhodes College campus, mostly settling on the roof of Burrow Hall, which was then the library. Eventually, the monkeys were recaptured after eating some tranquilizer-laced popcorn.


Now, the monkeys have escaped again, and again decided to visit the Rhodes campus. They have all been captured except one very sneaky monkey who is has taken up residence in the BCLC ballroom. However, nobody can seem to locate the monkey in the ballroom, since it mostly hides and only comes out from time to time. Rhodes College has turned to you to use your AI skills to capture the monkey.


Your program must read in a text file containing a sequence of the three sensor readings (M1, M2, and S). All three sensor readings are always provided. You must calculate and display the probability of the monkey being at every possible square in the grid at every time step.
